            <h2>Symbolism</h2>
            <p>The painting is full of symbolic meaning. The fog, mountains, and vastness of the scene represent the sublime, a concept in Romanticism referring to the overwhelming awe and terror of nature. The figure's solitary presence in the landscape could symbolize the human condition—small and insignificant in the grand scheme of nature, yet capable of reflection and contemplation. It is often seen as a reflection of existential themes such as man's place in the universe and his relationship with nature.</p>

            <h2>Artistic Technique</h2>
            <p>Friedrich's use of light and shadow in this painting is masterful. The misty sea below is bathed in soft, ethereal light, creating an atmosphere of mystery and isolation. The sharp contrast between the solid, rocky figure of the wanderer and the soft, blurry fog helps emphasize the figure’s solitude. Friedrich's typical use of dramatic natural settings captures the emotional intensity and spiritual power of the natural world.</p>
