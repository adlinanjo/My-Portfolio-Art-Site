            <h2>The Style</h2>
            <p>Guernica is painted in a monochromatic palette of black, white, and gray, reflecting the somber and tragic subject matter. Picasso used Cubist techniques to break down forms into fragmented shapes, creating a sense of disarray and confusion. The figures are distorted, further enhancing the emotional intensity of the work.</p>

            <h2>Symbolism</h2>
            <p>Each element in the painting carries symbolic meaning. The screaming horse, for example, represents the suffering of the people and the violence of the bombing. The figure of the mother holding a dead child symbolizes innocence destroyed by war. The light bulb in the center of the composition is often interpreted as a symbol of the destructive power of technology, while the wounded soldier represents the casualties of war.</p>

            <h2>Artistic Technique</h2>
            <p>Picasso's use of abstraction and Cubism in Guernica was revolutionary for its time. The fragmented, angular forms and chaotic composition help convey the confusion and trauma of war. The lack of color intensifies the emotional impact, focusing the viewer's attention on the figures and their expressions of horror.</p>
